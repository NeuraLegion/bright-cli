# NexPloit CLI

**NexPloit CLI** is a Command Line Interface ([CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)) tool for [NeuraLegion's solutions](https://www.neuralegion.com). You can use **NexPloit CLI** for full control over scans such as: initialize, stop, poll, maintain and more. In addition, **NexPloit CLI** can serve as a [Repeater](https://kb.neuralegion.com/#/guide/introduction/deployment-onprem) to scan local targets, without exposing them to the internet.

##### Features:
- Supports official API
- Configurable using JSON / XML / YML / JS formats
- Can generate real interaction data (.har files) from mock interactions (Unit Tests), more info about NexMock [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neuralegion/nexmock)
- Can serve as a [Repeater](https://kb.neuralegion.com/#/guide/introduction/deployment-onprem) for communication from the cloud to a local target
