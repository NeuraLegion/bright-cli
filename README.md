## Installing NexPloit CLI

Major versions of NexPloit CLI follow the supported major version of NexPloit.

Install the CLI using the npm package manager:

```bash
npm install -g @neuralegion/nexploit-cli
```
For details about changes between versions, and information about updates on previous releases, see the Releases tab on GitHub: https://github.com/NeuraLegion/nexploit-cli/releases

## CLI command-language syntax

NexPloit CLI accepts a wide variety of configuration arguments, run `nexploit-cli --help` for a thorough documentation.
Configuration arguments in the command-line must be passed after the program command that NexPloit CLI is executing.

`nexploit-cli command_name required_arg [optional_arg] [options]`
* Most commands, and some options, have aliases. Aliases are shown in the syntax statement for each command.
* Option names are prefixed with a double dash (--). Option aliases are prefixed with a single dash (-). Arguments are not prefixed. For example:
```bash
nexploit-cli scan:stop --api-key my-api-kye my-scan-id
```
* Typically, the generated artifact can be given as an argument to the command or specified with the `--archive` option (See `archive:generate`).

## Configuration files

Any configuration options that can be set via the command line can also be specified in the `nexploit` stanza of your package.json, or within a seperate configuration file - a variety of flavors are available:

| File name       | File Association |
|-----------------|------------------|
| `.nexploit`        | JSON             |
| `.nexploit.json`   | JSON             |
| `.nexploit.yaml`   | YAML             |
| `.nexploit.yml`    | YAML             |
| `nexploit.config.js` | CommonJS export  |

See `nexploit-cli --help` for all options available.
You can set these in any of the files listed above, or from the command line.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Starting with NexPloit CLI is easy.

First, install NexPloit CLI globally:

```bash
npm install @neuralegion/nexploit-cli -g
```

Next, go to the directory of your project and run the command:

```bash
nexploit-cli -h
```

If you already have a prepared mock file, you can generate a HAR file with the following command:

```bash
nexploit-cli archive:generate \
    --mockfile .nexmock \
    --archive archive.har \
    --target url-tested-application \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer my-jwt-authentication-token"
```

Where `mockfile` is the path to your mockfile and `archive` is the path to save the HAR file to.

The [archive:generate](#-generate-archive-based-on-nexmock) command will generate a new archive at the archive path:

```
Project
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .nexploitrc       // CLI configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .nexmock          // your mock requests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ archive.har       // generated HAR file
```

> ‚ú¥ In addition, you can specify authorization or authentication headers and a base url for the tested application.

During the creating of the archive, you can edit the `.nexploitrc.json` file and add your own options, such as:

```json
{
  "api-key": "my-jwt-authentication-token",
  "target": "url-tested-application",
  "timeout": 5000,
  "pool": 100,
  "host-filter": ["hostname-application"]
}
```

> ‚ú¥ You can also declare one of following .nexploitrc, .nexploitrc.json, .nexploitrc.yml, .nexploitrc.yaml, nexploit.config.js files.

However, most of the time you'll only need to configure api-key, target and maybe host-filter options.

Once the configuration is completed, upload the .HAR (or OAS) file with:

```bash
nexploit-cli archive:upload \
      --discovery archive \
      archive.har
```

The [archive:upload](#-upload-archive) command will output an ID of a new archive, which you can use to run a new scan:

```bash
nexploit-cli scan:run \
      --name scan-name \
      --archive received-archive-id \
      --protocol http \
      --api-key my-jwt-authentication-token
```

That's it, a new scan will be initiated immediately (or queued) in the [NexPloit application UI](https://nexploit.app).
You can continue working with this scan directly in the application UI.

## Command Overview

This section contains information on using NexPloit CLI's commands.

### üì• Upload Archive

`nexploit-cli archive:upload [options] <file>` uploads passed .HAR/.WSAR (or OAS) into your [NeuraLegion Storage](https://nexploit.app/storage).

> ‚ú¥ If you plan to upload OAS file to the storage, you can specify a different discovery option by setting the `--discovery` to `oas`.

The command will output an ID of a new archive, which you can use to run a new scan.

> ‚ú¥ If the archive with that name already exists, you'll receive the following error message: `The file with that name already exists or the HAR/WSAR file is corrupted.`

#### Arguments

| Argument  |  Description |
|---|:---|
| `<file>` | A collection of your app's http/websockets logs exported into a .HAR or .WSAR file. Typically, you can use any browser's dev tools or [NeuraLegion's browser extension](link-link-link-link) to generate them. In addition, you can use an OAS file that describes your public API. |

#### Options

| Option  |   Description |
|---|:---|
| `--api-key=yourApiKey`, `-K=yourApiKey` | The unique identifier used to authenticate a user. It can be issued in your organization dashboard |
| `--discovery=archive/oas` | The discovery strategy. Helps determine the best way to parse passed files. Default: `archive`|
| `--discard=false/true`, `-d=false/true` | When `true`, removes an archive from the cloud storage after the scan is finished running. Default: `true` |
| `--header=extraHeader`, `-H=extraHeader` | Extra headers to be passed with the OAS file. Also, it can be used to remove a header by providing a name without content, for example: `-H "Host:"`. **WARNING**: headers set with this option overide the archive headers and will be set in all the requests |

### üõ†Ô∏è Generate Archive Based on NexMock

`nexploit-cli archive:generate [options]` creates HTTP Archive (HAR) files from mock requests generated by 
unit-testing and other local automations. 
Supports the latest [NexMock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neuralegion/nexmock) API and provides additional features to help you generate HAR files during CI/CD workflows with ease.

Provides the ability to split NexMock file into multiply HAR files. For this purpose, you should specify the `--split` option, which accepts the number of pieces to split into.

```bash
nexploit-cli archive:generate \
  -m .nexmock \
  -f archive.har \
  -t url-tested-application \
  -s 4
```

This command will create 4 .HAR files which comply with following pattern: `<basename>(_<number>)?.<extension>`. 
E.g. `archive.har`, `archive_2.har` and etc.

#### Options

| Option  |   Description |
|---|:---|
| `--archive=newArchivePath`, `-f=newArchivePath` | The path where the new archives will be created, relative to the new workspace root. |
| `--mockfile=nexmockPath`, `-m=nexmockPath` | A NexMock file is obtained from the NexMock Reporters. See [E2E Guide](https://github.com/NeuraLegion/nexploit-cli/wiki/End-to-End-Guide#karma-or-mocha) |
| `--target=hostnameOrIp`, `-t=hostnameOrIp` | The target hostname or IP address. |
| `--header=extraHeader`, `-H=extraHeader` | Extra headers to be passed with the NexMock file. Also, it can be used to remove a header by providing a name without content, for example: `-H "Host:"`. **WARNING**: headers set with this option overide the archive headers and will be set in all the requests |
| `--pool=size`, `-p=size` | The size of the worker pool. Indicates how many requests NexPloit CLI can performs in parallel. Default: `250` |
| `--timeout=milliseconds` | The time to wait for a server to send response headers (and start the response body) before aborting the request. Default: `5000` |
| `--split=numberPieces`, `-s=numberPieces` | The number of the HAR pieces. Allows to split a NexMock file into multiple HAR files. Default: `1` |

### üèÉ Run Scan

`nexploit-cli scan:run [options]` starts a new scan with the received configuration. 

> ‚ú¥ If you don't have enough available engines, the scan will be placed in the queue. The new scan will start, if you manually stop another running scan or when it is done.

This command allows you to specify one or more of the discovery strategies, for example using the`--crawler` option and/or  the generated .HAR/.WSAR files, seperately or both at the same time. This means that you can handle client side dynamic content, javascript, etc.

#### Options

| Option  |   Description |
|---|:---|
| `--api-key=yourApiKey`, `-K=yourApiKey` | The unique identifier used to authenticate a user. It can be issued in your organization dashboard |
| `--name=extraHeader`, `-n=extraHeader` | The name of the scan. |
| `--archive=archiveID`, `-a=archiveID` | The Archive ID, which can be received via the `archive:upload` command. |
| `--crawler=url`, `-c=url` | Allows to specify a list of specific urls that should be included during crawler discovery. |
| `--protocol=http/websocket`, `-p=http/websocket` | The exploited protocol. Default: `http` |
| `--type=appscan/protoscan` | The type of scan. Default: `appscan` |
| `--module=dast/fuzzer` | The `dast` module tests for specific scenarios, such as OWASP top 10 and other common scenarios. The `fuzzer` module generates various new scenarios to test for unknown vulnerabilities, providing automated AI guided fuzz-testing. Default: `dast` |
| `--host-filter=hostOrIp`, `-F=hostOrIp` | The list of specific hosts that should be included in the scan. |
| `--header=extraHeader`, `-H=extraHeader` | Extra headers to be passed with the Archive file. Also, it can be used to remove a header by providing a name without content, for example: `-H "Host:"`. **WARNING**: headers set with this option overide the archive headers and will be set in all the requests |

### üöì Check Scan Status

`nexploit-cli scan:polling [options] <scan>` configures an ongoing polling of a scan's status, and helps you follow its progress during CI/CD flows.
